# ðŸ«€ Heart Failure Prediction with Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Heart Failure Prediction** project! This repository is all about predicting heart failure using machine learning models, comparing their performance, and learning something cool along the way.  

## ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights

- **Dataset**: We used the [Heart Failure Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) from Kaggle.
- **Models**:
  - Logistic Regression (Baseline Model)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- **Platform**: All experiments were conducted on **Google Colab**, with the help of Google Drive for dataset access.  

## ðŸ§° Requirements  

Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll need to get started:  

- **Python 3.x**  
- Key libraries:  
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
